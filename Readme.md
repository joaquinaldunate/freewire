# FreeWire 

FreeWire is a platform to prototype solutions based on MCUs and peripherals without wires that its also compatible with an indutrial solution form factor. The motivation behind this project is to add the flexibility of modular solution as the one provided by MCUs board and its peripherals, that came in diferent form factors, but with a form factor for all peripherals that is compatible with an industrial casing solution, that do not requiere fliying wires.

The industrial form factor enables a robust, flexible, and easy to develop open source platform that can be used as replacement for traditional PLC solutions.

This repository contains the source code for a PCB baseboard compatible with ESP32 MCU that have 2 or 4 FreeWire ports.
